# Image2Minecraft
### A small Ruby script for converting images to collages of Minecraft textures.

### To run, first install necessary gems
```rb
gem install mini_magick yaml
```

### Using the `ruby` command. 
If you're on MacOS, it comes preinstalled. Installation instructions for other operating systems exist at [Ruby's Official Website](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)

### Then, run by specifying an input and output file
```rb
ruby main.rb input.jpg output.jpg
```

Note: feel free to add whichever textures or images you want to the `imgs/` directory if you'd like them to appear in the collage!
